# Practical-Machine-Learning

## Summary of Projet
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
This is a report describing how the model was built, cross validated, the expectations of sample error, and why the choices were made regarding certain things. This will also use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
